# Multi-Agent AI Hedge Fund System

This project simulates a hedge fund powered entirely by AI agents organized in a hierarchical structure, closely resembling a real-world financial organization.

At the core is a **CEO Agent**, responsible for making high-level buy/sell decisions. A network of **analyst agents ("employees")** operate under the CEO and independently investigate market data using tools connected to [Financial Datasets](https://www.financialdatasets.ai/). Each agent can explore real-world stock data, analyze trends, and summarize insights.

The CEO dynamically interacts with agents, requests deeper investigations, and gathers their reports before making final trading decisions.
